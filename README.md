# RobuT
Data and code for ACL 2023 paper "RobuT: A Systematic Study of Table QA Robustness Against Human-Annotated Adversarial Perturbations"

## Prepare Environment
We officially support python 3.9. You could use following commands to install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## RobuT Dataset
We have released our dataset on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yilunzhao/robut). Use the following command to load the dataset (we use `RobuT-WTQ` as an example):
```python
datasets = load_dataset("yilunzhao/robut", split="wtq")
```
The dataset can also be found in `robut_data.zip` file.

## Experiments
To run each model on each RobuT subset, please execute the inference scripts in the `inference_scripts` directory. For example, use the following command to evaluate the performance of TAPEX on RobuT-WTQ:
```
bash inference_scripts/wtq/tapex.sh
```
The corresponding model output and scores can be found at `outputs/wtq/tapex-preds.json` and `outputs/wtq/tapex-scores.json`, respectively.
